# Day 7 â€“ Hangman Project ðŸª¢ðŸ’€

## Description
In this project, you build a classic **Hangman** game in Python. The player tries to guess a secret word letter by letter, with a limited number of attempts. A visual representation (ASCII art) shows the number of remaining lives.

## Features
- Word selection from a predefined word list  
- ASCII art for each stage of the game  
- Tracks guessed letters  
- Displays blanks and correct letters dynamically  
- Handles win and lose conditions

## Example Output
```

- Conditional logic and control flow (`if`, `else`, `while`)  
- Loops for iteration  
- Indexing and comparison  
- ASCII formatting  
- Game loop and game state tracking
